this is my dotfiles repo. they're managed using [yolk](https://github.com/elkowar/yolk).

i used to use Stow, but it was too inflexible for my needs, and i wasn't able to properly centralize all my configs. yolk provides reasonable templating into config files, allowing me to centralize configs while still including non-overlapping machine-specific configs emplaced onto disk.

rhai is a bit of an annoyance. some documentation to come.

big plans for how i intent to eventually deploy this to Every Machine I Touch, with documentation also to be written later
